# Contributing Guidelines

If you would like to contribute to the repository, there are a few things you could do.

## Reporting issues or suggesting features

Feel free to open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pyrox18/Pyrox.BlazorComponents.DataGrid/issues) if you would like to report a bug or make suggestions.

## Directly modifying the source code

This repository utilises the [OneFlow branching model](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow), so it helps if you're familiar with it.

If you're interested in making changes to the code yourself, fork the repository and make the changes on your fork. Then, open a pull request targeting the master branch with some details about the changes that you have made.

### General Guidelines

- [Standard Git commit message conventions](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) apply. Please adhere to these conventions.
- Pull requests should always target the dev branch, and not the master branch.
- Check the dev branch and/or existing pull requests first to see if someone else had already made the same changes that you want to make.
